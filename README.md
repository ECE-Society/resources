4. Follow the Fork-Commit-Pull Request cycle for contributing, more on this [here](https://github.com/ECE-Society/resources/blob/master/rules.md). All pull requests should be made for `devel` branch only.
5. If you create a new topic folder make sure to **link that folder in landing page `README.md`**
